<h1>Culture of Kerala</h1>
<p>Studies that scientifically evaluate the factors that account for the distinctive features of Kerala culture, the historical circumstances that brought about their formation and transformation, the structural reorganizations that they underwent during various historical periods and their ideological functions have not yet been properly undertaken. What stands on the way is the hegemonic historical ideology that gratifies the common sense notions, and glosses over contradictions and the text book methodology that sustains it.

The only way to get over this stagnation is the recognition that any reference of any time to the past is formed within a discourse of the present. The historian can, through this recognition, become aware of the social interests that operate unconsciously behind his practice. The historian who thus becomes aware of the interests of the present operative behind his activity, can take on a conscious position through breaking away from the unconscious forces; and adopt a scientific approach to history.

This introduction is nothing but the beginning of an attempt to study the history of Kerala culture with this kind of an awareness of the contradictions of the present that impel to present different portrayals of the past.

Such an attempt is mainly to get over the two methodological approaches which, though are fundamentally the products of one and the same field of discourse, assume antithetical forms on the practical plane. The first is the manner of viewing the culture of a people as an absolute force that transcends the material life and that is self-determined and autonomous. It would have each culture taken as an external manifestation of an eternal and absolute essence. It views the history of culture as that of the series of rise and fall of these archetypes. This concept, while on the one hand, sees the human history as that of the challenges and responses that the essential identity of such cultural essence confronts, on the other, reduces the history of each people to its cultural specifics. This method that considers the history of culture as the determining force is fundamentally the same religious method that by keeping the inexplicable as the hidden parameter employs itself to explain everything else. In effect, it is a reductive process that integrates abstractly the various streams and breaks of history into the abstract discourse called culture. Though this culturistic reductionism that sees culture as all-embracing and all-determining, often masquerading as materialistic and sociological, is basically none other than the fundamentally religious cyclic production of knowledge that produces nothing new.</p>

The next is the limitation of the sociological approaches that keep itself apart from the abstract humanism that attends on these culturistic reduction. Most of the sociological studies that claim to be objective and scientific are caught up in an unscientific notion of science itself. Its method is to see the concept of objectivity as one of positivism; and it tends to consider the reduction of social phenomena into the formation of inductive - deductive logic as scientific. In the absence of concrete theories that reach beyond the generalization of tangible facts and that could be of use in the study of history and culture, these sociological studies eventually become reductions to some determining essence or the other. By reducing in this manner the culture specifics of a people to its geography or to race or to some social institutions or even to its food habits, it can be presented as scientific truth. When those historians who would like to be known as Marxists assume this scientificity, the culture of a people gets reduced to economic essence more than to other essences. It is not the Marxist concept of science but the positivist concept that operates here. According to the Marxist concept of history, the determination of the economic factor is not a concept based on the method of considering the economic factor as the supreme truth and everything else as its ephemeral phenomena. Marxist historiography when seen as on empiricist methodology, becomes one among the many reductionist methods of sociological kind.

It is only by taking these culturistic and sociologistic reductions as points of divergence that the history of a people's culture can be subjected to a scientific analysis. Such an analysis cannot consider culture as located within the limits of the discourse of culture as formulated by the European bourgeois nationalism that has come into being in the wake of the decline of feudalism, in its attempt to perpetuate its own ideological forms. It has also to steer clear of the orientalistic cultural studies that were formed in an attempt to extend as world-wide this concept of culture that had been the basis of a new system of knowledge originating from the eighteenth century.

Orientalism was mainly another outcome of the studies on oriental countries within the field discourse of culture that was a concomitant of the attempt to perpetuate the ideological forms of bourgeois nationalism by generalizing them. The privileged western position characteristic of the Euro-centric concept of man and the infatuation for the east were its inherent contradictions. The contradiction involved plundering the colonies and at the same time to have to bring them under new production relations and to have to incorporate the old world into the new without shaking its foundations. Orientalism was nothing but the ideological sphere that theoretically legitimized the oriental studies of the Europeans necessitated by this contradiction. The ideologues of Indian nationalism studying its culture, by following and imitating the Europeans, were also acting within this sphere. Even today, those who go into raptures over such matters as the Indian religion, Indian philosophy and Indian aesthetics are conditioned in their thinking habits by this field of discourse.

The task that a study of Indian culture or of the Kerala culture as its part faces is not so much that of answering the polemics formed within the former problematic as that of shifting that problematic itself. Such a shift does not call for a redefinition of an abstraction of an essence-culture, but instead an explanation of how such definitions themselves have come about. What it really calls for is the concrete materialist interpretation that is at variance with the value world of abstract universalist humanism that is the undercurrent of such definitions. It is because the study of culture is nothing but the objective analysis of the functions and of the concrete mode of operation of the ideological forms and the contradictions implicit in it, that are necessitated by each historical phase. It is the material life and not the abstract essence called culture, that develops in the process of human history. This is not to say that it is only the economic life of man that is real and that the ideological forms are false. Economic structure and ideological forms do not operate as mutually exclusive. They are interrelated and interdependent realities. The ideological sphere is as much concrete and real as the economic one, being the different fronts of struggle of the very material life.</p>
<p>
In short, a scientific study of the history of Kerala culture cannot be bound down to the ideology that bodied forth in terms of the newly formed Kerala nationalism. The ideology of Kerala nationalism, though it is a historically generated reality is one that tends to view culture as the continuation of an abstract human essence, like that of any other nationalisms elsewhere. In fact, a class that came into being at a certain stage of Kerala history, by projecting its value system on to the past, was endeavouring to confirm its own existence as that of man of all times. Such an outlook of history can only perceive the forms of family, of the state and the allied social institutions that existed from time to time in the past, from within its own frame. A historian who adheres to such a frame can conceive of the sexuality of any other time only in terms of the sexuality which he himself partakes of; and can consider the structure of power-relations of any other time only with reference to those which he himself is a part of. Even the best of our history text books would bear this out.

Now, understandably, this can lead to a series of questions in this context. Cannot the limitation, described above, be justified in the light of the statement made earlier, that any reference of any time to the past is formulated only within a discourse of the present? Accordingly, what else can even those who try to break away from this limitation hope to do other than to project from within another perspective, their own self image on to the past? If so, is it not pointless to call to question this perennial inadequacy of historiography of any time?

It is here that the matter of the contradistinction between subjective and objective concepts of history grounded in class positions, makes itself felt. It is a matter of the contradistinction between ideological subjectivity and the scientific-theoretical objectivity. History being the projection of self-consciousness of a class and being the object of knowledge of a science are two contrary concerns. Incidentally, it may be noted that what is proposed here as the science of history does not imply the generalization of factual data, derived from the parameters of other empirical sciences, as is common in sociologistic reductions.

These are the issues of an emergent new science through the coming into practice of a specific theoretical field and its own object of knowledge together with a mode of discourse that relates them. It is in Marxism that history by thus becoming the object of knowledge of a specific concrete theory transforms itself into a science. It is at this point that historiography by ceasing to be the projection of the subjectivity of class positions evolves into objective scientific practice. It is from there onwards that historiography by ceasing to be the expression of the self-consciousness of the present and by waking into the theoretical consciousness of the contradictions of the present, orients itself to perceive any historical period with such an objectivity.

Still, the Marxist periodization of history, the determinacy of the infrastructure and the relation between the infra and superstructures are taken as empirical generalizations evolved from European history both by most of those who approve of it and who denounce it. That is why while some hold that periodizations of history like primitive communism, slavery, feudalism, capitalism etc., being relevant only to the European society, have no bearing on the history either of India or Kerala, others go on to prove that those periods in western society repeat themselves in Indian history. The former discard the Marxist theory of historical evolution as just the empirical description of European history and, the latter hold the empirical description itself to be the scientific theory. Both equally stop short of distinguishing the concreteness and universality of a scientific theory from the generalization of empirical data. The Marxist scientific theory of history about historical stages holds true the world over equally well. Because, it is not the generalization of the history of any particular society. It is a concrete theory that goes to embrace and interpret the infinite complexities and specificities of each particular society.

It is in this respect that the scientific concepts regarding periodization as well as relation between the economic structure and ideological forms of each period, are applied in this outline of the history of Kerala culture.</p>
